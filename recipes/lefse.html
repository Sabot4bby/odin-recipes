    <ul class="description">
      <li>10 pounds potatoes, peeled</li>
      <li>½ cup butter</li>
      <li>⅓ cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

      <li>
        Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil.
        Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes;
        drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Run hot potatoes through a potato ricer into a large bowl. Beat butter,
        cream, salt, and sugar into riced potatoes. Let cool to room
        temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir flour into potato mixture to form a soft dough. Pull off pieces of
        dough and form into walnut-sized balls. Lightly flour a clean cloth and
        roll out lefse balls to 1/8-inch thick.
      </li>
      <li>Heat a griddle over high heat.</li>
      <li>
        Cook lefse on the hot griddle until brown blisters form, about 1 minute
        per side. Place cooked lefse on a damp towel to cool slightly. Repeat
        with remaining dough, stacking them on top of each other as they're
        cooked; cover until ready to serve.
